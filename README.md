# Hi, I'm LowByteFox!
Iâ€™m a (primarily) system level programmer, digital artist, content creator and a vtuber. I am (as of now) writing free & open-source software (FOSS) in my free time and have been for about 4 and half years, I also happen to draw from time to time, stream on Twitch as a vtuber (PNGTuber). I also happen to be a furry. My goal is to write simple, user friendly & re-usable software to make the world a better and simpler place.
