# Hi, I'm NeoByteNova!
I'm an open-source programmer and I'm 19 years old, my general username is `LowByteFox` but I change display username according to fursona I currently use (I may be trans, just don't know yet).<br>
Nowadays, I mostly write code using C and sometimes write POSIX shell scripts! Currently on my 7th attempt to learn Rust! No skipping this time heh<br>

> No, I won't replace C with Rust, I'll make some projects in C and some others in Rust, etc

You can find some of my projects here on Codeberg and the rest on my [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~lowbytefox/) account. Some older projects can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/LowByteFox/) account<br>
I like UNIX-like systems such as `Linux`, `FreeBSD` & `OpenBSD`<br>
I'm also a furry :3

Personal Projects:
- **Proot** - Protogen themed, toy operating system using the Linux kernel
- **OpenPNGStudio** - Create & stream PNGTuber models with ease
- **Fin** - Simple to-do + reminder app in Perl
- **ZeonDB** - Multi-model, high performance, NoSQL database in C++
- **Buchta** - Bun-First integrable build tool for frontend
- **Bun.nvim** - NeoVim plugin for Bun JavaScript runtime
- **Foxdo** - Minimal `sudo` implementation
- **Foxnit** - Wrapper for the `runit` init system

I'm currently working on `OpenPNGStudio` so in the future I can create my own PNG model, become a vtuber and stream on `Twitch`! Only if I wasn't procrastinating haha!<br>
